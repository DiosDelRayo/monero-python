# Todo
- [ ] export key images as blob
    - [ ] convert json to binary
    - [ ] encrypt
        - [x] chacha20 -> CryptoDome
        - [x] cn_fast_hash
            - [x] keccak_256
        - [x] ed25519
        - [ ] cn_slow_hash
- [ ] encrypt/decrypt seed phrase, or probably more key, check in `monero/src/cryptonote_basic/cryptonote_format_utils.cpp` from monero
    - [ ] add `cn_slow_hash` implementation from `monero/src/crypto/slow-hash.c` from monero
    - [ ] add `sc_add` implementation from `monero/src/crypto/crypto-ops.c` from monero
    - [ ] add `sc_sub` implementation from `monero/src/crypto/crypto-ops.c` from monero
- [ ] strip not needed functionality
- [ ] remove dependencies where possible
    - [?] pynacl~=1.4, assume is needed to sign
    - [?] pysocks~=1.7, assume is not needed how we are offline and airgapped
    - [?] requests, assume we don't need it as long we don't need any daemon/rpc on device
    - [?] ipaddress
    - [?] varint, think this was needed but double check
    - [?] pycryptodomex~=3.14, pretty sure it get's used, but maybe fork pycryptodomex and shake it down to what we really need
